# Power BI Virtual Case Experience

This is to showcase my work which I have done as a part of PwC Power BI Virtual Case Experience,completed through the Forage Platform.


## Task 

The Case Experience included mainly three tasks

**Task-1: Call Centre Trends Dashboard**

A call center trends dashboard has to be designed to provide real-time insights into call center performance, which can be later used as a basis for discussion with management.Hence relevant metrics and KPIs should be included.

**Task-2: Customer Retention Dashboard**

A customer retention dashboard has to be prepared to track and analyze the churned customers so that the company can know in advance about the customers at risk.

**Task-3: Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard**

A diversity and inclusion dashboard has to be made which can be used by the company  to track and measure their diversity and inclusion efforts since the company is interested in creating a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world.
